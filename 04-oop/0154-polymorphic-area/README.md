# 0154 — Polymorphic Area

Sum the areas of a Rectangle(2,3)=6 and a Triangle(base=4,height=4)=8 through a common Shape interface, printing `total area: 14`. Iterating a `List<Shape>` dispatches `area()` to each concrete class via polymorphism.

## Run

    kotlinc Area.kt -include-runtime -d area.jar && java -jar area.jar
